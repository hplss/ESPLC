  The purpose of this class is to serve as the main PLC controller object. All rungs and objects that are created by the parser are controlled by this object.
 The object will read (scan) the rungs in sequential order and report any errors along the way as needed.
  This will also serve as the interpreter for the PLC logic. Human generated logic is read from a source, then the corresponding objects/rungs are created and organized as needed.
  The parser (with the help of the PLC_Main object) will attempt to verify that there are no duplicate objects being created in memory, and will also report errors to the user interface as needed.

/*Remote controlling of other "ESPLC" devices:
MODE 1: - The secondary device acts purely as an IO expander, where the primary device initializes ladder objects on the secondary, and sends updates to it as necessary. 
		The secondary device performs no logic processing.  
MODE 2(?): - Gather a list of available (initialized) objects already being processed on the external device. 
			This allows the external device to perform its own logic operations, and the primary device to poll the status of different ladder objects (bits,inputs,outputs,etc) 
			and use it for its own calculations. This is ideal for a decentralized "cluster" type operation. 
			
Scripting Syntax: Other devices are accessed by IP (or hostname?) and corresponding port. DEV1=EXTERNAL(<IP>) 
Ladder objects are accessed using bit operators and corresponding device ID's. 
Example(1): DEV1.<ID> -- Accessing an object directly (such as inputs and outputs)
Example(2) DEV1.<ID>.EN -- Accessing a bit of an external object.
Objects that cannot be acessed directly: MATH object types
Notes: Maybe the Web UI could perform a query across local IP ranges to find available devices automatically (only if connected to router/gateway)
It my also be possible to have another ESP device directly connect to the primary device. 
Problems: -- What triggers the seach? 
The user (explicitly via serial command or web UI). 
The script (maybe if a list of valid devices hasn't been built?) 
If a device explicitly connects to the ESP (primary), it can easily send a signal to the primary indicating that it's an expander.

For clustered operation: multiple TCP connections can be supported for sending/receiving data.
